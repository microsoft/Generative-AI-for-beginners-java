# Practical Applications & Projects

## What You'll Learn
In this section, we’ll explore three practical applications that highlight generative AI development patterns with Java:
- Build a multi-modal Pet Story Generator combining client-side and server-side AI
- Integrate local AI models using the Foundry Local Spring Boot demo
- Create a Model Context Protocol (MCP) service with the Calculator example

## Introduction

This chapter presents **sample projects** that illustrate generative AI development patterns with Java. Each project is fully functional and demonstrates specific AI technologies, architectural patterns, and best practices that you can adapt for your own applications.

### Foundry Local Spring Boot Demo

The **[Foundry Local Spring Boot Demo](foundrylocal/README.md)** shows how to integrate local AI models using the **OpenAI Java SDK**. It demonstrates connecting to the **Phi-3.5-mini** model running on Foundry Local, enabling you to develop AI applications without relying on cloud services.

### Pet Story Generator

The **[Pet Story Generator](petstory/README.md)** is an interactive Spring Boot web application that demonstrates **multi-modal AI processing** to create imaginative pet stories. It combines client-side and server-side AI capabilities, using transformer.js for browser-based AI interactions and the OpenAI SDK for server-side processing.

### MCP Calculator Service (Beginner-Friendly MCP Demo)

The **[MCP Calculator Service](calculator/README.md)** is a straightforward demonstration of the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** using Spring AI. It provides an easy introduction to MCP concepts, showing how to build a basic MCP Server that interacts with MCP clients.

## Learning Progression

These projects are designed to build on concepts from earlier chapters:

1. **Start Simple**: Begin with the Foundry Local Spring Boot Demo to learn the basics of AI integration with local models.
2. **Add Interactivity**: Move on to the Pet Story Generator to explore multi-modal AI and web-based interactions.
3. **Learn MCP Basics**: Try the MCP Calculator Service to understand the fundamentals of the Model Context Protocol.

## Summary

Great job! You’ve now explored some real-world applications:

- Multi-modal AI experiences that operate both in the browser and on the server
- Integration of local AI models using modern Java frameworks and SDKs
- Your first Model Context Protocol service, demonstrating how tools can interact with AI
